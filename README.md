# PCDKL-v1-main
PCDKL: Physics-constrained deep kernel learning for inverse problems with noisy data

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the folder of the corresponding case (e.g., /PCDKL/2D_d_r_system_Inverse, /PCDKL/B_g_Inverse, etc.).
2. Run the script PCDKL.py inside each case folder to train the PCDKL model and generate the results.
